#### Server:
1. Download and install Microsoft .NET Core 3.1 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1
    - On Windows you most likely need the Hosting Bundle for ASP.NET Core Runtime 3.1.32 ([Direct link](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/6744eb9d-dcd4-4386-9d87-b03b70fc58ce/818fadf3f3d919c17ba845b2195bfd9b/dotnet-hosting-3.1.32-win.exe
))
2. Download the latest release of the Multiplayer server from the [Releases](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Multiplayer/releases) page
3. Unzip the BlasServer.zip file anywhere on the host machine

#### Client:
1. Download the latest release of the Modding API from https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Modding-API/releases
2. Follow the instructions there on how to install the api
3. Download the latest release of the Multiplayer client from the [Releases](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Multiplayer/releases) page

## Connecting

First, the server should be started by running the BlasServer.exe program on the host machine.  Then all of the clients should be able to connect by running the ```multiplayer connect [SERVER] [NAME] [PASSWORD]``` command
<br>
However, the client must have a network connection to the machine running the server.  If not on the same local network, find out how to use port forwarding, Hamachi (https://vpn.net/), or ZeroTier (https://www.zerotier.com/)
