## Features

- See other players as you both move around the world of Cvstodia
- Sync items, stats, skills, and other game progress across all players
- Compatible with randomizer (Make sure to use the same seed and settings)
- Enable PvP to fight other players

## Sync details

### Things that sync

- All inventory items (Beads / Relics / Prayers / Hearts / Collectibles / Quest items)
- All player stats (Max health / Max fervour / Strength / Mea Culpa level / Max flasks / Flask level / Bead slots)
- All unlocked sword skills
- All revealed map cells
- All world state progress (Bosses defeated / Gates opened / Cherubs freed / Teleports unlocked / Questline progress / etc. )
- Church donation amount

### Things that will probably never sync

- Enemies & bosses (This is a huge task and not really feasible)

## PvP

PvP is now available in Blasphemous Multiplayer, but only for sword attacks right now (Prayers other than Debla do nothing).  To fight other players, change to a different team than them by either editing your config file or using the ```multiplayer team NUMBER``` command

## Connecting

First, the server should be started by running the BlasServer.exe program on the host machine.  Then all of the clients should be able to connect by running the ```multiplayer connect [SERVER] [NAME] [PASSWORD]``` command
<br><br>
However, the client must have a network connection to the machine running the server.  If not on the same local network, find out how to use port forwarding, Hamachi (https://vpn.net/), ZeroTier (https://www.zerotier.com/), or RAdmin
<br><br>
If using Hamachi, you may have to follow this [setup guide](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Windwaker-coop#how-to-set-up-hamachi-to-simulate-a-local-network) for it to work.  Then when connecting, use the IP address that Hamachi assigned to the machine running the server.
